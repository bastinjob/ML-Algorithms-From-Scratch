# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project aims to implement various machine learning algorithms purely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms by coding them without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is to provide a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. By implementing these algorithms from scratch, you can gain insights into their underlying mechanics, which can help in:

- Improving your machine learning knowledge and skills.
- Understanding the theoretical aspects and practical applications.
- Enhancing problem-solving abilities by debugging and optimizing custom implementations.
- Preparing for interviews and academic research.

## Algorithms Implemented

The repository includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

### Supervised Learning

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Perceptron**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Naive Bayes**

### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

### Reinforcement Learning

- **Q-Learning**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The only external library required to run these implementations is NumPy. Ensure you have it installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install numpy
